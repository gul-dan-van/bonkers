# Bonkers

A game developed with the of pygame based upon inappropriate internet culture of a doge bonking (non-british word) monsters that appeal for bonking (british word).

The _main.py_ file contains some functions that could be helpful for other pygame developers, like:
>**Wrap function** to give game agents torroidal movement, that is, to exit game window from one side and appear from other.
>**Rotate function** to give direction property to game agents with respect to a given body.
>**Bat class**, which tackled the tricky task of rotating an image body and maintained that direction to move.
